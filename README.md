# fileShare
Quickly share files with others by sending them a link, using your own web server. People with the link can download the file.

To start using it, use Apache and rename the htaccess file. Edit the .htaccess file to configure a public URL that will be part of the file links, a username for you, a password for you, and a secret token for your session so that you can log in and upload & delete files.

If you don't want to use Apache, set your web server environment variables to those that are named in the htaccess.txt file and configure them as described above.
